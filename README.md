In my math classes, I create in-class groups to work together on a variety of learning activities.

My primary work-flow for this would be to shuffle the list in an Excel workbook (by creating a column of random numbers,
then sorting by that column, then dragging students into groups of 4. I would then save that page to a PDF to post in class.

When I had just one math class each semester, this wasn't a problem.

However! At my new job I will have four math classes, creating new teams probably three or four times each semester. So
I wanted to write a program to automate that. This is that program.

The program, when finished will:
* Extract the list of student names from an Excel file
* Randomly place the students into groups of three or four
* Produce a PDF file listing those groups

This should be fun!
